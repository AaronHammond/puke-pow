puke-pow
========
Short for public key encryption/proof of work, puke-pow is a work in progress to develop a method for PCI compliant entry, storage, and transmission of cardholder data. The method is outlined in part in the whitepaper PuKE-POW.pdf, and a simple proof-of-concept, sample implementation in Java is provided. Note that there is some discrepancy between the Java implementation and the proposed implementation as a matter of necessity to compensate for some less-than-ideal behavior of RSA.
